LangChain is an open-source framework aimed at streamlining the development of applications utilizing large language models (LLMs). It offers a standardized interface for creating chains, extensive integrations with various tools, and pre-built chains for common tasks. This framework enables AI developers to build applications that leverage combined LLMs like GPT-4 alongside external computational resources and data. Available in both Python and JavaScript, LangChain operates through a general pipeline: users input a question to the language model, which then searches for relevant information in a vector database based on the question's vector representation. The retrieved information is then provided to the language model, which generates a response or initiates an action accordingly.
